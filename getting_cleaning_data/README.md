Samsung Fit Tidy Dataset Creation
=================================

## Introduction
The `run_analsis.md` script creates a tidy dataset `tidied.txt` of the Galaxy S Smartphone accelerometer data consisting of the mean and standard deviation measurements in the data. Additionally, another tidy dataset `averages.txt1` is created that consists of he averages of the tidied values for each variable and activity combinations.

The orignal data came from experiments which recorded the data from volunteers as they wore a Galaxy S II smartphone on their waist as they performed different activities. See the README.txt included with the data for more information.
